Please note this project is now **deprecated** in favour of the [Google APIs PHP Clients][4] project.

Google Custom Search API PHP Client
===================================

This client library enables you to interact with the Google Custom Search API in PHP allowing you to retrieve and display search results from your Google Custom Search programmatically.

Requirements
------------

This client library is only supported on PHP 5.2.4 and up.

The Google Custom Search API requires an API key, which you can get from the [Google APIs console][1].

You will also need a [Google Custom Search][2] ID or specification URL to search.

Installation
------------

Simply download the client library and add the `src` folder to your project.

Usage
-----

Performing a Google Custom Search is very simple. For example,

    require_once('src/Google/CustomSearch.php');

    $search = new Google_CustomSearch('lectures');
    $search->setApiKey('API_KEY');
    $search->setCustomSearchEngineId('017576662512468239146:omuauf_lfve');

    $response = $search->getResponse();

The `$response` variable is now an instance of `Google_CustomSearch_Response`. This object contains your search results and information about your search, e.g. total number of results, etc.

To iterate over the results, you can do the following,

    if ($response->hasResults()) {
        foreach($response->getResults() as $result) {
            echo $result->getTitle() . ' - ' . $result->getLink() . '<br />';
        }
    }

Each single result is an instance of `Google_CustomSearch_Response_Result`.

Please see the [Google Cusom Search API reference][3] for detailed information on the data available in the response.

Testing
-------

To run the tests, make sure you have PHPUnit installed, and run,

    phpunit tests/
